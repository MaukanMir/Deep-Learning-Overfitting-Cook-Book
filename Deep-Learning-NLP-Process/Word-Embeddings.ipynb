    "## What Are Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "### A word embedding is a learned representation for text where words that have the same meaning have a similar representation. It is this approach to representing words and documents that may be considered one of the key breakthroughs of deep learning on challenging natural language processing problems.\n"

    "## Word2Vec\n",
    "\n",
    "### Word2Vec is a statistical method for efficiently learning a standalone word embedding from a text corpus. It was developed by Tomas Mikolov, et al. at Google in 2013 as a response to make the neural-network-based training of the embedding more efficient and since then has become the de facto standard for developing pre-trained word embedding.\n",
    "### Additionally, the work involved analysis of the learned vectors and the exploration of vector math on the representations of words. For example, that subtracting the man-ness from King and adding women-ness results in the word Queen, capturing the analogy king is to queen as man is to woman.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two different learning models were introduced that can be used as part of the Word2Vec approach to learn the word embedding; they are:\n",
    "* Continuous Bag-of-Words, or CBOW model.\n",
    "* Continuous Skip-Gram Model."

    "## GloVe\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Global Vectors for Word Representation, or GloVe, algorithm is an extension to the Word2Vec method for efficiently learning word vectors, developed by Pennington, et al. at Stanford. Classical vector space model representations of words were developed using matrix factorization techniques such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) that do a good job of using global text statistics but are not as good as the learned methods like Word2Vec at capturing meaning and demonstrating it on tasks like calculating analogies (e.g. the King and Queen example above).\n",
    "\n",
    "### GloVe is an approach to marry both the global statistics of matrix factorization techniques like LSA with the local context-based learning in Word2Vec. Rather than using a window to define local context, GloVe constructs an explicit word-context or word co-occurrence matrix using statistics across the whole text corpus. The result is a learning model that may result in generally better word embeddings.\n"

    "### You may choose to learn a word embedding for your problem. This will require a large amount of text data to ensure that useful embeddings are learned, such as millions or billions of words. You have two main options when training your word embedding:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learn it Standalone, where a model is trained to learn the embedding, which is saved and used as a part of another model for your task later. This is a good approach if you would like to use the same embedding in multiple models.\n",
    "* Learn Jointly, where the embedding is learned as part of a large task-specific model. This is a good approach if you only intend to use the embedding on one task."
