    "\n",
    "### A word embedding is a learned representation for text where words that have the same meaning have a similar representation. It is this approach to representing words and documents that may be considered one of the key breakthroughs of deep learning on challenging natural language processing problems.\n"

    "## Word2Vec\n",
    "\n",
    "### Word2Vec is a statistical method for efficiently learning a standalone word embedding from a text corpus. It was developed by Tomas Mikolov, et al. at Google in 2013 as a response to make the neural-network-based training of the embedding more efficient and since then has become the de facto standard for developing pre-trained word embedding.\n",
    "### Additionally, the work involved analysis of the learned vectors and the exploration of vector math on the representations of words. For example, that subtracting the man-ness from King and adding women-ness results in the word Queen, capturing the analogy king is to queen as man is to woman.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two different learning models were introduced that can be used as part of the Word2Vec approach to learn the word embedding; they are:\n",
    "* Continuous Bag-of-Words, or CBOW model.\n",
    "* Continuous Skip-Gram Model."
