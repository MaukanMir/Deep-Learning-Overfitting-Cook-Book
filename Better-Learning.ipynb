    "* Overfitting refers to a model that has learned the training dataset too well, including the statistical noise or random fluctuations in the training dataset.\n",

    "* The problem with overfitting, is that the more specialized the model becomes to training data, the less well it is able to generalize to new data, resulting in an increase in generalization error. This increase in generalization error can be measured by the performance of the model on the validation dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This often occurs if the model has more capacity than is required for the problem, and, in turn, too much flexibility. It can also occur if the model is trained for too long. A plot of learning curves shows overfitting if:\n",

    "* The plot of validation loss decreases to a point and begins increasing again.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The inflection point in validation loss may be the point at which training could be halted as experience after that point shows the dynamics of overfitting. The example plot below demonstrates a case of overfitting."
