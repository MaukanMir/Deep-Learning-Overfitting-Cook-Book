    "### We can address underfitting by increasing the capacity of the model. Capacity refers to the ability of a model to fit a variety of functions; more capacity, means that a model can fit more types of functions for mapping inputs to outputs. Increasing the capacity of a model is easily achieved by changing the structure of the model, such as adding more layers and/or more nodes to layers. Because an underfit model is so easily addressed, it is more common to have an overfit model. An overfit model is easily diagnosed by monitoring the performance of the model during training by evaluating it on both a training dataset and on a holdout validation dataset. Graphing line plots of the performance of the model during training, called learning curves, will show a familiar pattern.\n",
