    "### We can address underfitting by increasing the capacity of the model. Capacity refers to the ability of a model to fit a variety of functions; more capacity, means that a model can fit more types of functions for mapping inputs to outputs. Increasing the capacity of a model is easily achieved by changing the structure of the model, such as adding more layers and/or more nodes to layers. Because an underfit model is so easily addressed, it is more common to have an overfit model. An overfit model is easily diagnosed by monitoring the performance of the model during training by evaluating it on both a training dataset and on a holdout validation dataset. Graphing line plots of the performance of the model during training, called learning curves, will show a familiar pattern.\n",

    "* Calculate the sum of the absolute values of the weights, called the L1 norm (or L1).\n",
    "* Calculate the sum of the squared values of the weights, called the L2 norm (or L2).\n",
    "#### L1 encourages weights to 0.0 if possible, resulting in more sparse weights (weights with more 0.0 values). L2 offers more nuance, both penalizing larger weights more severely, but resulting in less sparse weights. The use of L2 in linear and logistic regression is often referred to as Ridge Regression. This is useful to know when trying to develop an intuition for the penalty or examples of its usage."
