    "#### Pooling can be used to downsample the content of feature maps, reducing their width and height whilst maintaining their salient features. A problem with deep convolutional neural networks is that the number of feature maps often increases with the depth of the network. This problem can result in a dramatic increase in the number of parameters and computation required when larger filter sizes are used, such as 5 × 5 and 7 × 7.\n",
    "#### To address this problem, a 1 × 1 convolutional layer can be used that offers a channel-wise pooling, often called feature map pooling or a projection layer. This simple technique can be used for dimensionality reduction, decreasing the number of feature maps whilst retaining their salient features. It can also be used directly to create a one-to-one projection of the feature maps to pool features across channels or to increase the number of feature maps, such as after traditional pooling layers.
